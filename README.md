I'm Julian. My alias online is generally Isaiah Schiroyisey, since that's the pseuedonym I used to write my book, ""Trouts"". I put that in double quotes because you use quotes to signify small works and the raw title itself includes quotation marks because I thought that would be funny. I can't really say what the book's about, nor can I tell you why, nor can I tell you why I can't tell you why, and so on (I promise it's not for pretentious reasons).

I am an amateur 3D artist (using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), of course).

*kin la toki pona li pona tawa mi*. I also like [toki pona](https://tokipona.org/), a language with only 137-ish words. It's very easy to learn and very fun to use, because you have to try to simplify what you're trying to say into a combination of various basic concepts.

In terms of coding, I'm a complete amateur, I mainly just made this account to mess around.
