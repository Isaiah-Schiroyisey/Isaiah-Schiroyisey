# About Me

I'm Julian. My alias online is generally Isaiah Schiroyisey, since that is the pseuedonym I used to write my book, ""Trouts""[^1]. I put that in double quotes because you use quotes to signify small works and the raw title itself includes quotation marks because I thought that would be funny. I can't really say what the book's about, nor can I tell you why, nor can I tell you why I can't tell you why, and so on.

I am an ameteur 3D artist (using <a href="http://blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>, of course).

*kin la toki pona li pona tawa mi*. I also like <a href="https://tokipona.org/" target="_blank">toki pona</a>, a language with only 137-ish words (there are some words that were added after its conception, some of which are controversial, so it depends on your preferences). It's very easy to learn and very fun to use, because you have to try to simplify what you're trying to say into a combination of various basic concepts.

[^1]: Maybe I'll put a link here later, but don't count on it.
