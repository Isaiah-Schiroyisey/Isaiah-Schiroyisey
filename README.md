I'm Julian. My alias online is generally Isaiah Schiroyisey, since that's the pseuedonym I used to write my book, ""Trouts""[^1]. I put that in double quotes because you use quotes to signify small works and the raw title itself includes quotation marks because I thought that would be funny. I can't really say what the book's about, nor can I tell you why, nor can I tell you why I can't tell you why, and so on (I promise it's not for pretentious reasons).

I am an amateur 3D artist (using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), of course).

*kin la toki pona li pona tawa mi*. I also like [toki pona](https://tokipona.org/), a language with only 137-ish words (there are some words that were added after its conception, some of which are controversial, so it depends on your preferences). It's very easy to learn and very fun to use, because you have to try to simplify what you're trying to say into a combination of various basic concepts.

In terms of coding, I'm a complete amateur, I mainly just made this account to mess around. Don't expect any serious projects.
